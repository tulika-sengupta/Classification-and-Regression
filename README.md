# Classification-and-Regression
A) Implemented Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA). Implemented two functions in Python: ldaLearn and qdaLearn which take a training data set (a feature matrix and labels) and return the means and covariance matrix (or matrices). Implemented two functions ldaTest and qdaTest which return the true labels for a given test data set and the accuracy using the true labels for the test data.
B) Implemented Linear Regression, non-linear Regression, Ridge Regression and Gradient Descent for Ridge Regression.
